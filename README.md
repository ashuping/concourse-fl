This repository holds the website for the (fictional) City of Concourse, Florida.

## Subdirectories

The `/concourse-client` directory holds the frontend files. The frontend uses [`react`](https://github.com/facebook/react), and was created with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The `/concourse-server` directory holds the backend files. The backend uses [`express`](https://github.com/expressjs/express), and was created with [`express-generator`](https://github.com/expressjs/generator).

## Available Scripts

In the root directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs both the frontend and backend in development mode.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
